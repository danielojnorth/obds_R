```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Part 1
Create a vector of integers from 1 to 10.

```{r}
v <- 1:10
```


Compute the log2 of each value in the vector using either lapply() or sapply().

```{r}
sapply(X = v, FUN = log2)
lapply(X = v, FUN = log2)
```

Part 2
Create a list of four elements, each element being a vector of type either numeric or logical.

```{r}
l <- list(1:10, c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE), c(2, 44, 18, 12), c(FALSE, TRUE))
```


Compute the sum of each vector in the list using either lapply() or sapply().

```{r}
sapply(X=l, FUN = sum)
```

Use sapply() on the list that you created in part 2, to repeat each element of each vector three times. Each is an argument acting on rep.

```{r}
sapply(X = l, FUN = rep, each = 3)
```
